# CPSC-351-Operating-System-Concept
CSUF with Instructor John Oates

Operating systems are the basis of modern computing. They manage system physical resources such
as memory, the CPU, keyboard, printer. They support applications. They are the microcosms which
spring to life every time your power on your computer, smartphone, or tablet.
In this course we will take a plunge into the world of operating systems. Not only will you learn about
the concepts underlying the design and implementation of modern operating systems, but you will
experience them through real-world, hands-on projects. Mastery of the material will empower you to
write more robust, efficient, and secure code, and gain deeper understanding of how computers perform
everyday tasks. You will also, hopefully, come to appreciate the importance of operating systems in
computing as we know it
